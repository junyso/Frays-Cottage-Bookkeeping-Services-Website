# TASK LIST - PENDING

## BACKUP STATUS

### OneDrive Backup
- ✅ Backup folder created: `OneDrive/Apps/OpenClaw-Backup/`
- ✅ Script created: `~/.openclaw/workspace/backup-workspace.sh`
- ✅ Initial sync completed
- Files backed up:
  - USER.md
  - SOUL.md
  - MEMORY.md
  - IDENTITY.md
  - TASKS.md
  - All workspace files

### Strategy
- Local-first: Files always exist locally in ~/.openclaw/workspace/
- OneDrive acts as mirror/backup
- Safe from subscription lapses (local files unaffected)

### To run manual backup:
```bash
~/.openclaw/workspace/backup-workspace.sh
```

### OpenClaw Setup
- Gateway token mismatch — needs resolution
- Web interface not fully connected
- Action: Run `openclaw update` then `openclaw doctor --generate-gateway-token`

## MEDIUM PRIORITY

### Client Folder Template
- Design exists (10-tier structure)
- Needs to be created as actual folder structure
- Location: TBD (Templates folder?)

### Desktop Cleanup
- 1,600+ files mixed with dates/formats
- Needs systematic organization

### Pilot Client Folder
- Which client? Needs selection
- Apply standardized structure

### Voice Note Transcription
- File: /Users/julianuseya/.openclaw/media/inbound/44294da4-2422-4ed2-895c-d5715b0445ba.ogg
- Status: Whisper was downloading model, interrupted

## ONGOING

### Research
- Available on demand
